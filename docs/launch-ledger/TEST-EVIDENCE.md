# Test evidence index

Use task records as the source of actual counts, commands, expected RED regressions, error paths, isolation/auth/consent/idempotency coverage and limitations. Never combine separate executions into a fictional single-run result.

All other preserved focused regressions are indexed chronologically in [TIMELINE](TIMELINE.md). Documentation-only slice validation checks relative link existence, exact SHA/ancestry, preserved historical file hashes and whitespace; no application test rerun is warranted without a source change. Commands and runtime credentials remain outside new documentation; use sanitized fixture/configuration references.
